The git concepts that I was struggling with was creating a new branch and being in that directory and the same time.  git checkout -b .  Also the fetch and the merge concepts.
The fetch and merge conflict were clarified for me.  The differences betweeen fetching and cloning are now clear.
The guide once again clarified the differences between fetch and cloning a repo
After this assignment I feel that the concepts to this point on git make sense
The session went well but unfortunately our guide had issues with sound and we couldn't really understand her.
